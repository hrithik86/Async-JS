## What is a Callback?
A callback is a function that is executed after another function has finished executing. Functions can take functions as arguments and can be returned by other functions. Functions that take another function as an argument are called higher-order functions. So, the callback function can also be defined as any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.

Callbacks are used to make sure that a function is not going to execute before a task is completed but will execute right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from future errors.

In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another function, and then to call it back right after something has happened or some task is completed.
